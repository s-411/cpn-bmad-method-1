## üîß Technical Implementation

### How Referral Tracking Works

1. **URL Detection**: When someone visits `yourapp.com?via=AFFILIATE_CODE`
2. **Cookie Storage**: Rewardful sets a 60-day cookie
3. **Session Persistence**: Our `useReferralTracking` hook stores in sessionStorage
4. **Auto-Enrollment**: After onboarding, user becomes affiliate via API
5. **Conversion Ready**: When Stripe is added, conversions will auto-track

### Key Files

- **Tracking Hook**: `/lib/hooks/useReferralTracking.ts`
- **API Integration**: `/lib/rewardful.ts`
- **Affiliate Dashboard**: `/app/referrals/page.tsx`
- **Onboarding Integration**: `/app/onboarding/results/page.tsx`
- **Webhook Handler**: `/app/api/webhooks/rewardful/route.ts`

### API Usage Examples

```typescript
// Check if user came from affiliate link
const { referralId, affiliateCode } = useReferralTracking();

// Track conversion (after Stripe payment)
trackConversion(email, amount, orderId);

// Create affiliate (happens automatically)
const affiliate = await rewardfulAPI.createAffiliate(email, firstName);

// Get affiliate stats
const stats = await rewardfulAPI.getAffiliateReferrals(affiliateId);
```

## üìä Commission Structure

- **Rate**: 50% commission on all sales
- **Cookie Duration**: 60 days
- **Payout Threshold**: $25 minimum
- **Payment Terms**: Net 30 (paid monthly)

### Earnings Breakdown
- **Weekly Subscription ($1.99)**: Affiliate earns $0.99 per conversion
- **Lifetime Access ($27)**: Affiliate earns $13.50 per conversion

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Add Secret Keys** to `.env.local`
2. **Configure Webhook** in Rewardful dashboard
3. **Test Affiliate Link** with a test parameter

### When Stripe is Integrated

The following will automatically work:

1. **Conversion Tracking**: Add to Stripe checkout:
   ```javascript
   // In your Stripe checkout session creation
   const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
     client_reference_id: referralId, // From useReferralTracking hook
     // ... other Stripe config
   });
   ```

2. **Commission Attribution**: Rewardful will automatically:
   - Detect the Stripe payment
   - Match it to the referral
   - Calculate commission
   - Update affiliate dashboard

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Rewardful is not defined"**
   - Ensure `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_REWARDFUL_API_KEY=2dfb17`
   - Restart dev server after adding env variables

2. **Affiliate not created**
   - Check browser console for API errors
   - Verify secret key is set (for server-side calls)

3. **Referral not tracked**
   - Check URL has `?via=` parameter
   - Verify cookies are enabled
   - Check browser console for Rewardful initialization

## üìà Success Metrics

Track these KPIs in your Rewardful dashboard:

- **Affiliate Signups**: Users auto-enrolled after onboarding
- **Click-Through Rate**: Visits from affiliate links
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage who upgrade to paid
- **Average Commission**: Per affiliate earnings
- **Top Performers**: Most successful affiliates

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never expose** `REWARDFUL_SECRET_KEY` to client-side code
- **Always verify** webhook signatures in production
- **Rate limit** affiliate API calls to prevent abuse
- **Monitor** for suspicious affiliate activity
