### Data Integration
- **Context Usage**: Leverages existing `useGirls()`, `useDataEntries()`, `useGlobalStats()` hooks
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatic recalculation when underlying data changes
- **Performance Optimization**: Memoized calculations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind-based responsive breakpoints for all screen sizes

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
const DashboardPage = () => {
  const { girlsWithMetrics, isLoading: girlsLoading } = useGirls();
  const { dataEntries, isLoading: entriesLoading } = useDataEntries();
  const { globalStats, isLoading: statsLoading } = useGlobalStats();

  const isLoading = girlsLoading || entriesLoading || statsLoading;

  // Real-time derived calculations
  const recentActivity = useMemo(() =>
    dataEntries.slice(-5).reverse(), [dataEntries]);

  const performanceInsights = useMemo(() =>
    calculateInsights(girlsWithMetrics), [girlsWithMetrics]);
};
```

## Design System Integration

### Visual Hierarchy
